I translate complex analytical challenges into robust, measurable solutions by applying the rigorous problem-solving skills honed as a former Physicist. My work covers the full data lifecycle: from scalable cloud ETL pipelines and data architecture design to deep analytical modeling and impactful Business Intelligence solutions. My focus is transforming complex data into clear, measurable results.
